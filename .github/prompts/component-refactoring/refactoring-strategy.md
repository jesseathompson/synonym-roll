# Synonym Roll Refactoring Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive refactoring strategy for the Synonym Roll application, focusing on improving component structure, styling, state management, performance, and TypeScript usage.

## Refactoring Goals

1. **Improve component structure** - Create small, reusable components with single responsibilities
2. **Enhance CSS approach** - Implement CSS modules with BEM naming convention
3. **Optimize state management** - Use reducers for complex game logic
4. **Boost performance** - Add memoization and prevent unnecessary re-renders
5. **Strengthen TypeScript usage** - Enhance type definitions and type safety

## Component Hierarchy

The refactoring will result in the following component hierarchy:

```
App
├── Navigation
│   ├── InfoModal
│   └── SettingsModal
└── Pages
    ├── Home
    └── Play
        ├── GameBoard
        │   ├── WordTile (start)
        │   ├── SynonymList
        │   │   └── WordTile (synonyms)
        │   ├── WordTile (end)
        │   ├── GameControls
        │   └── GameTimer
        └── CompletedState
            ├── WordPath
            │   └── WordTile (path)
            ├── StatsDisplay
            └── GameControls (share)
```

## Refactoring Phases

### Phase 1: Component Structure Refactoring
1. Extract UI components (WordTile, SynonymList, etc.)
2. Create layout components (GameBoard, Navigation)
3. Establish clear component hierarchy

### Phase 2: CSS Modules Implementation
1. Create design token system with CSS variables
2. Implement component-scoped CSS with modules
3. Apply BEM naming convention consistently

### Phase 3: State Management Improvements
1. Create game play state reducer
2. Refactor theme management
3. Enhance game state context

### Phase 4: Performance Optimizations
1. Add memoization for expensive calculations
2. Prevent unnecessary re-renders
3. Optimize event handlers

### Phase 5: TypeScript Enhancements
1. Improve type definitions
2. Add proper generics and utility types
3. Enhance type safety throughout the codebase

## Implementation Approach

For each component to be refactored, follow these steps:

1. **Analyze** - Understand the current implementation
2. **Plan** - Determine the desired structure and behavior
3. **Implement** - Create the new component with proper styling
4. **Test** - Write tests and Storybook stories
5. **Integrate** - Replace the old implementation

## Dependencies and Integration Order

To minimize integration challenges, components should be refactored in this order:

1. **Design Token System** - Create the foundation for styling
2. **UI Components** - Build the basic building blocks (WordTile, etc.)
3. **Feature Components** - Create game-specific components (SynonymList, GameTimer, etc.)
4. **Custom Hooks** - Refactor state management (useTheme, useGamePlayState)
5. **Layout Components** - Implement structural components (GameBoard, Navigation)
6. **Page Components** - Update the high-level pages (Play, Home)

## Testing Strategy

For each refactored component:

1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests** - Test component interactions
3. **Storybook Stories** - Document component variations and states
4. **Visual Testing** - Ensure consistent appearance across viewports

## Conclusion

By following this refactoring strategy, the Synonym Roll application will become more maintainable, performant, and aligned with modern React best practices. The component-by-component approach allows for incremental improvements while maintaining a functioning application throughout the process.
