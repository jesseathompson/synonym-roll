# Navigation Component Refactoring

## Objective
Refactor the existing `Navigation` component to follow component best practices, use CSS modules, and implement a more modular approach.

## Component Details

### Location
`app/src/components/layout/Navigation/Navigation.tsx`
`app/src/components/layout/Navigation/Navigation.module.css`

### Props Interface
```tsx
interface NavigationProps {
  className?: string;
}
```

### Functionality
- Display the application header with logo and title
- Provide navigation links
- Include settings and info modal buttons
- Handle modal visibility state

### Current Implementation
The current Navigation component includes:
- Navbar with logo and title
- Links to different parts of the application
- Buttons for settings and info modals
- Modal state management

## CSS Requirements
- Use CSS module with BEM naming convention
- Apply appropriate styling for navigation elements
- Ensure responsive behavior for different viewport sizes
- Use design tokens for colors, spacing, etc.

## Storybook Story Requirements
Create a Storybook story that demonstrates:
- Default navigation display
- Responsive behavior at different viewport sizes
- Modal trigger functionality (using mocked modals)

## Testing Requirements
Write tests that verify:
- Navigation renders with correct elements
- Modal visibility state works correctly
- Links have appropriate URLs

## Important Notes
- Focus ONLY on refactoring this component and its related files
- Do NOT refactor InfoModal and SettingsModal components yet
- Consider performance with React.memo if appropriate
- Ensure the component is accessible (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- Consider how this component fits into the overall application structure
