# Game Progress LocalStorage - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented localStorage persistence for in-progress games so users can leave and return to continue playing without losing progress.

## What Was Implemented

### âœ… localStorage Persistence for Game Progress

**Problem Solved**: Users would lose all progress if they:
- Refreshed the page
- Closed the tab and returned
- Browser crashed
- Switched tabs on mobile

**Solution**: Automatically save and restore game state using localStorage with smart validation.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Storage Helper Functions

Added three helper functions in `useGamePlayState.ts`:

```typescript
// Save current game state
const saveGamePlayState = (state: GamePlayState, puzzleNumber: number) => {
  // Saves state with puzzle number and timestamp
}

// Load saved state with validation
const loadGamePlayState = (
  currentPuzzleNumber: number,
  startWord: string,
  endWord: string
): GamePlayState | null => {
  // Only restores if same puzzle
  // Clears old data if puzzle changed
}

// Clear saved state
const clearGamePlayState = () => {
  // Removes saved progress
}
```

### 2. Smart State Management

**Validation Checks**:
- âœ… Puzzle number must match (same day)
- âœ… Start word must match (same puzzle)
- âœ… End word must match (same puzzle)
- âœ… Don't restore completed games
- âœ… Handle corrupt/invalid data gracefully

**Auto-cleanup**:
- âœ… Clears on game completion
- âœ… Clears when new puzzle starts
- âœ… Clears if puzzle doesn't match

### 3. Timer Continuity

The timer now:
- âœ… Saves elapsed time
- âœ… Resumes from saved time on restore
- âœ… Auto-starts if game was in progress
- âœ… Doesn't reset to 0 on page refresh

### 4. Files Modified

#### `app/src/hooks/useGamePlayState.ts`
- Added storage key constant
- Added StoredGamePlayState interface
- Added save/load/clear helper functions
- Updated hook signature to accept `puzzleNumber`
- Modified initialization to check localStorage first
- Added useEffect to save state on changes
- Added useEffect to restore timer for in-progress games

#### `app/src/pages/Play.tsx`
- Moved `puzzleNumber` declaration before hook call
- Passed `puzzleNumber` to `useGamePlayState` hook

#### `app/src/hooks/useGamePlayState.test.ts`
- Updated all test calls to include `puzzleNumber: 1`

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: Start New Game
1. User visits site
2. No saved progress found
3. Fresh game starts
4. User selects synonyms
5. Each step automatically saved to localStorage

### Scenario 2: Page Refresh Mid-Game
1. User has made progress (e.g., 3 steps, 45 seconds)
2. User refreshes page
3. Hook loads saved state from localStorage
4. Validates it's the same puzzle
5. Restores: steps, current word, timer (45s), moves
6. Timer resumes counting
7. User continues exactly where they left off

### Scenario 3: Complete Game
1. User reaches end word
2. Game marks as completed
3. Completion handler triggers
4. localStorage automatically cleared
5. Stats saved to global state
6. Next visit starts fresh

### Scenario 4: New Day
1. User returns next day
2. Puzzle number has incremented
3. loadGamePlayState validation fails
4. Old progress automatically cleared
5. New puzzle starts fresh

### Scenario 5: Multiple Tabs
1. User has multiple tabs open
2. Makes progress in Tab A
3. Switches to Tab B
4. Tab B loads latest saved state
5. Last saved state wins (by design)

## Storage Structure

```json
{
  "gamePlayState": {
    "steps": ["start", "word2", "word3"],
    "currentWord": "word3",
    "targetWord": "end",
    "isCompleted": false,
    "elapsedTime": 45,
    "totalMoves": 3,
    "synonyms": ["word4", "word5"],
    "minSteps": 2,
    "puzzleNumber": 650,
    "savedAt": 1728766234567
  }
}
```

## Edge Cases Handled

### âœ… Different Puzzle
- Saved puzzle number doesn't match
- Start/end words don't match
- **Result**: Old state cleared, fresh start

### âœ… Completed Game
- Game marked as completed
- **Result**: State cleared immediately

### âœ… Corrupted Data
- JSON parse error
- Missing required fields
- **Result**: Try/catch handles gracefully, returns null

### âœ… localStorage Disabled
- Private browsing mode
- Storage quota exceeded
- **Result**: Graceful degradation, works without saving

### âœ… Stale Data
- Timestamp saved for future use
- Could add expiration check (e.g., > 24 hours)
- **Result**: Currently validates by puzzle number

## Benefits

### ðŸŽ¯ User Experience
- âœ… **No Lost Progress**: Can safely refresh or close tab
- âœ… **Seamless Resume**: Pick up exactly where left off
- âœ… **Mobile Friendly**: Handles app switching, background tabs
- âœ… **Forgiving**: Accidents don't cost progress

### ðŸ”’ Data Safety
- âœ… **Daily Scoped**: Won't restore wrong puzzle
- âœ… **Auto-cleanup**: Old data removed automatically
- âœ… **Validated**: Multiple checks prevent bad data
- âœ… **Error Resistant**: Handles corrupt data gracefully

### ðŸ’» Technical
- âœ… **Lightweight**: Uses browser localStorage
- âœ… **Fast**: No network calls
- âœ… **Reliable**: Works offline
- âœ… **Backward Compatible**: Gracefully degrades

## Testing Done

### Build Verification
âœ… **Build Status**: Successful (2.85s)
```bash
npm run build
âœ“ 389 modules transformed
âœ“ built in 2.85s
```

### Linter Verification
âœ… **No Errors**: All files pass linting

### Test Suite
âœ… **Tests Updated**: All useGamePlayState tests pass with new signature

## Manual Testing Recommended

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Start puzzle, make progress, refresh â†’ progress restored
- [ ] Complete puzzle â†’ saved state cleared
- [ ] Wait until next day â†’ old progress not restored
- [ ] Timer shows correct time after restore

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Close tab completely, reopen â†’ progress restored
- [ ] Clear localStorage manually â†’ game starts fresh
- [ ] Multiple tabs â†’ latest state persists
- [ ] Complete in one tab â†’ other tabs clear on next action

### User Experience
- [ ] No flash of wrong state on load
- [ ] Synonym list shows correctly after restore
- [ ] Can go back after restore
- [ ] Stats update correctly after restore

## Storage Keys Used

- **Global Stats**: `gameState` (already existed)
  - Stores: gamesPlayed, wins, streak, theme, etc.
  
- **Game Progress**: `gamePlayState` (new)
  - Stores: current steps, time, moves, puzzle number

## Backward Compatibility

- âœ… **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality unchanged
- âœ… **Fresh Start Works**: Works without saved state
- âœ… **Global State Unaffected**: Existing stats system unchanged
- âœ… **Tests Pass**: All tests updated and passing

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Potential Improvements
1. **Visual Indicator**: Show "Progress Restored!" toast message
2. **Expiration**: Add 24-hour expiration for saved state
3. **Multiple Puzzles**: Save progress for multiple puzzle modes
4. **Sync Across Devices**: Use cloud storage for cross-device sync
5. **Analytics**: Track how often progress is restored

## Files Changed

1. âœ… `app/src/hooks/useGamePlayState.ts` - Core implementation
2. âœ… `app/src/pages/Play.tsx` - Pass puzzleNumber
3. âœ… `app/src/hooks/useGamePlayState.test.ts` - Updated tests

## Deployment

Ready to deploy! Users will immediately benefit from progress persistence:

```bash
cd app
npm run deploy:aws:app
```

After deployment, users can:
- âœ… Refresh without losing progress
- âœ… Close tab and return later
- âœ… Switch apps on mobile
- âœ… Continue from where they left off
