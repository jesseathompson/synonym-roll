- [ ] Review CloudFront settings
- [ ] Review Route 53 records

### Step 4: Deploy Certificate Stack
- [ ] `npm run deploy:cert` initiated
- [ ] CloudFormation stack creation started
- [ ] Certificate request submitted
- [ ] DNS validation records created automatically
- [ ] Certificate status: "Issued" (may take 5-10 minutes)

### Step 5: Deploy Application Stack

- [ ] Origin points to S3 bucket
- [ ] Error responses configured (404 â†’ index.html)

### Route 53 DNS
- [ ] A record exists for apex domain
- [ ] A record exists for www subdomain
- [ ] Both records point to CloudFront (alias records)
- [ ] DNS resolving correctly: `dig A synonym-roll.com`

- [ ] Client-side routing works (refresh any route)
- [ ] Assets load (images, fonts, CSS)
- [ ] JavaScript executes without errors (check console)
- [ ] Game is playable

### Performance
- [ ] Initial page load < 3 seconds
- [ ] Subsequent navigation instant (SPA)
- [ ] Assets cached properly
- [ ] No 404 errors in browser console

## Troubleshooting Checklist

If something goes wrong:

### Certificate Issues
- [ ] Check certificate status in ACM console
- [ ] Verify DNS validation records in Route 53
- [ ] Wait up to 30 minutes for validation
- [ ] Check domain uses Route 53 nameservers

### CloudFront Issues
- [ ] Check distribution status (not "In Progress")
- [ ] Verify origin access identity configured
- [ ] Check S3 bucket policy allows CloudFront
- [ ] Test CloudFront URL directly

### DNS Issues
- [ ] Verify hosted zone nameservers match domain
- [ ] Check A records exist and are aliases
- [ ] Test with `dig A synonym-roll.com`
- [ ] Wait up to 48 hours for propagation

### Build Issues
- [ ] Clean build: `rm -rf app/dist app/node_modules`
- [ ] Reinstall: `cd app && npm install`
- [ ] Rebuild: `npm run build`
- [ ] Check for TypeScript errors

### CDK Deploy Issues
- [ ] Check AWS credentials are valid
- [ ] Verify account has sufficient permissions
- [ ] Review CloudFormation stack events
- [ ] Check for resource naming conflicts

## Maintenance Checklist

### Weekly
- [ ] Check CloudWatch metrics for errors
- [ ] Review CloudFront bandwidth usage
- [ ] Verify SSL certificate is valid

### Monthly
- [ ] Review AWS billing dashboard
- [ ] Check for cost anomalies
- [ ] Review access logs (if enabled)
- [ ] Update CDK and dependencies

### Quarterly
- [ ] Audit IAM permissions
- [ ] Review security best practices
- [ ] Test disaster recovery procedure
- [ ] Update documentation

## Rollback Checklist

If you need to rollback:

### Application Rollback
- [ ] Have previous dist/ backup
- [ ] Sync backup to S3
- [ ] Invalidate CloudFront cache
- [ ] Verify old version works

### Infrastructure Rollback
- [ ] Checkout previous git commit
- [ ] Run `npm run deploy`
- [ ] Verify resources restored
- [ ] Test functionality

## Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:

- âœ… Both URLs (apex and www) load the site
- âœ… HTTPS works with valid certificate
- âœ… Game is fully playable
- âœ… Client-side routing works correctly
- âœ… All assets load without errors
- âœ… Performance is acceptable (< 3s initial load)
- âœ… No console errors
- âœ… Mobile responsive design works

## Next Steps After Successful Deployment

1. Set up monitoring alerts
2. Configure CloudWatch dashboards
3. Enable S3 versioning
4. Set up backup strategy
